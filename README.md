## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
    
Specify the side of the street your house is on. For example, 1234 Main St. would be on the *even* side.

    $ curl localhost:3000/even
    in front of house.
    
    $ curl localhost:3000/odd
    across the street.
    
## Notes

If the current time is between noon and midnight, we are determining what side of the street the car should be parked on for *tomorrow*.
